#Formula for perimeter of a triangle Perimeter = a + b + c

#Variables with values assigned
side_one = 5
base = 6
side_two = 10

#Perimeter formula applied
perimeter = side_one + base + side_two

#Test for parimeter
# print(perimeter)

#Final perimeter output
# print('The perimeter of your triangle is:',perimeter)

#variable assigned for greater than
greater_than = side_one > side_two

#output for greater than
# print('Is side one greater than side two?',greater_than)

#variable assigned for equality
equal = base == side_one

#output for equality
# print('Is the base equal to side one?',equal)
