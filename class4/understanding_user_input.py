'''User Input'''

'''User input is always of the 'string' data type'''
#this doesn't store the input but it will appear in the terminal.
# input("Enter Your name: ")

#we have to assign our input to variables:
#we can assign variables and print them one after the other:
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# # age = input("Enter your age: ")
# # age += 1 #doesn't work because it is a string
# '''you have to type cast the input to an integer'''
# # age = int(age)

# '''FOR EFFICIENCY'''
# age = int(input('Type in your age: '))
# # age += 1
# print(f'Hello {name}')
# print(f'You are {age} years old.')
